In the span of one week, I was referred to as "this young lady" (or one of "these young ladies," when in meetings with my also female co-conspirator) at least three times. Each time, the speaker was an older man. Each time, the speaker was someone who I find generally agreeable to work with, who I genuinely believe respects me as a person and as a professional. But each time, I cringed a little. Each time, I also wondered how often this happens to "young men." I think I've seen it, though not frequently, and in those instances, the phrase seemed to be used in a more joking manner (not that that makes it any better).

Each time I am left wondering. Why does it matter that I am young or a woman? Is it so hard to say my (or our) names? My coworker and I wondered if we should introduce ourselves as librarians, to give them another noun (our actual titles are longer). Why not fall back on the neutral, inoffensive "folks"? What would happen if we were to respond, "thanks for the introduction, old gentleman"?

I'm sure that I'm thinking about this much more than the speakers, but perhaps that's the problem. In a male-dominated workplace, where many employees have worked for 30+ years, I'm already plenty aware of both my age and my gender. In a technical organization, in a role which borders between service and technical, it's easy to feel inadequate. I'm thankful for the people who consider me a professional. Removing "young woman" from the vernacular of meetings might help me actually believe it.
