One of the things on the long list of "things I must learn" inspired by the 2019 Code4Lib Conference was [vue.js](https://vuejs.org/).

Wizards are kind of a buzzword at workâ€”we have one that tells you how to mark documents, and we dream about one that would tell you which repository to use-and vue.js seemed like a good tool for making one. It also seemed like a finite project-one I could define, that would be more than a static webpage but could have a clear, specific end goal.

The "apology wizard" itself was born as a journal entry. I am frequently aware of my tendency to over apologize. I apologize for talking too much, for not talking enough, for not being clear enough, for being in the way, for being annoying... and I'm beginning to realize that perhaps my most annoying trait is my chronic apologizing. I made a list of things I frequently apologize for in my journal, and quickly realized that I simply apologize for being. I even made a flowchart to show myself when I should apologize. Writing it made it feel more real.

And so, this project is part code, part therapy. In fact, it's been a few months since I did most of it, and while I remember there being frustrations, I no longer recall the specifics of what they were or how I solved them. Like most projects, I began with an example project, and made small changes to make it my own. As usual, I was too impatient to first look at the (very good!) documentation, and as usual, my very patient boyfriend was willing to help when I was stuck.
