In the span of one week, I was referred to as "this young lady" (or one of "these young ladies," when in meetings with my also female co-conspirator) at least three times. Each time, the speaker was an older man. Each time, the speaker was someone who I find generally agreeable to work with, who I genuinely believe respects me as a person and as a professional. But each time, I cringe a little. Each time, I also wonder if this happens to "young men." I think I've seen it, though I believe those times it has been in a more joking manner (not that that makes it any better).

Why does it matter that I am young or a woman? Is it so hard to say my (or our) names? My coworker and I wondered if we should introduce ourselves as librarians, to give them another noun (our actual titles are longer). Or the neutral, inoffensive "folks"? What would happen if we were to respond, "thanks for the introduction, old man"?

I'm sure that I'm thinking about this much more than the speakers, but perhaps that's the problem. In a male-dominated workplace, where many employees have worked for 30+ years, I'm already plenty aware of both my youth and my gender. In a technical organization, in a role which borders between service and technical, it's easy to feel inadequate. I'm thankful for the people who consider me a professional. Removing "young woman" from the vernacular of meetings might help me actually believe it.
