Why Jekyll? Good question. I don't necessarily have a good answer. A colleague mentioned an interest in Jekyll, and I suppose I latched on and decided that was what I needed to learn. Some of the factors that went into that decision are:

Ability to host on GitHub Pages made it seem more accessible

Opportunity to play with css

It runs on Ruby.

I've never used Ruby, so I'm not sure why I found this appealing, but I've heard of it so figured it was an opportunity to learn more. The thing is, when you know so little, **everything** is an opportunity to learn.
