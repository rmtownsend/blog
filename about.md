# About page

Hello! My name is Rebecca. I'm a librarian(ish) just trying to learn all the things. Many of those things are related to coding. This site is a sandbox for me to learn Jekyll, and perhaps a place to document other attempts, accomplishments, and failures of learning to code, as well as thoughts on information, librarianship, and professional development.

More about me on my [contributor page](/blog/creators/rebecca.html).
